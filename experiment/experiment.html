                You have landed on an alien planet where coins can be any weight.</p>
            <p>We will represent coin weights with a number between 0 and 1. \
                The higher the weight, the more likely the coin is to land heads. \
                A weight of 0.5 means that the coin is fair, like the coins you are used to on planet Earth. \
                A weight of 0.8 means that the coin is engineered so that it lands heads 80% of the time.</p>

                Each student you see will come from a classroom, where they have seen a bunch of flips before.</p>
            <p>Here are the four classrooms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The students in Classroom A have already seen ${classroomParams.A.a} heads and ${classroomParams.A.b} tails. </li>

                remind you about these classrooms during the study.</p>
            <p>To teach effectively, you will want to consider how a learner’s classroom affects \
                how they interpret the examples you give them.</p>`,

                know that the student comes from one of two indicated classrooms, but you won’t \
                know exactly which classroom the student comes from.</p>
            <p>In some trials you will give the student one set of examples and in some trials \
                you will give the student two sets of examples. And in some of these trials, \

            <p>You can receive both an accuracy bonus and an efficiency bonus.</p>
            <p>As the experiment is going on, your students will guess the coin weights. \
                (In many of the trials you won’t see these guesses, but we will still use them \
                to calculate your bonus.) You will receive a bonus based on how accurate your students’ \
                guesses are (i.e. how close their guesses are to the actual coin weight).</p>
            <p>You will also receive a bonus based on how efficient your teaching is. The fewer flips you give, the higher your efficiency bonus.</p>
            <p>To earn as much money as possible, you will want to teach accurately and efficiently. You can think of this like \
                teaching in the real world: You want to lead the student to the right answer but give them only as much information as needed.</p>`
