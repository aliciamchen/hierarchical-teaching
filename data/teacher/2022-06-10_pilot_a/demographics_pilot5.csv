2,A2NA6X1SON3KFH,1698873,male,36,yes,"Well, I think the timer was way too short to read about the results and think of what to answer next, I felt rushed every time. Additionally, if possible, make it so that a player can enter their guess into the boxes without hitting the button and still count them if the timer runs out, because i did that in round 1, but it counted it as a no-answer."
