1,A10AVWALIHR4UQ,3045215,male,38,yes,5.91,"Just a minor comment, but having the text fields set to a small size on this page makes it difficult to edit since only a portion of a sentence can be seen at a time. It small improvement could be made by making the text fields larger.","The strategy that I used was to use as few turtles as possible in order to gauge what the student had previously seen when the situation was uncertain. I figured that using just one turtle was ideal. Once known, I could adjust the turtles to better fit the expected 70:30 or 30:70 ratio. In situations where there was only one chance to instruct or when the student's response was unknown after the first lesson, I assumed that the student saw the majority color and just sent the minority color turtles to get to the 70:30 ratio. Another strategy that I should have realized earlier was that with a two lesson student, if the student got the ratio nearly right after the first lesson, the best thing to do would be to add one turtle each to keep the ratio the same without incurring much cost. I tripped up on the first student and didn't send any when I should have (I realized that i was warned in the instructions but the time limit made me a little anxious and that slipped my mind at the time)."
2,A12J4IRF5Z06BT,1464619,male,39,yes,3.1,No,I tried to offset the color I was showing them to lead them in the right direction.

4,A1BM57TUNAQIXM,3214474,female,37,yes,2.6,None,"It was hard. My strategy was just not to guess which land they saw first if I was given 2 lands and just do my best to set a ""bar""."
5,A1E77HZO63E334,773303,male,28,yes,2.83,,"If I was given the either they say this or that type, I just used the given turtle ratio"
6,A1G187YBG0DVMQ,719942,male,30,yes,2.6,,try to be as close to the ratio as possible
7,A1NKBXOTZAI1YK,1624752,male,35,yes,3.2,"Thanks!  Fun task, though I wish I could have done better.  ",I just tried to manipulate them to the point they ended up on the correct ratio of turtles.  Sometimes it seemed impossible with the limited information.
8,A1PJLZSOUQ4MIL,2437179,female,43,yes,0.53,I have no idea how it was possible to earn a bonus here.,I thought I tried to show them a ratio that was close to the turtle composition
9,A1QNTSKBGSP86L,1675769,female,23,yes,4.37,Have a nice day,addition to what they already seen
10,A1SHLWKA0UH1IS,1158569,female,57,yes,5.28,"All good, thanks!",I tried to use the least amount of turtles to get the correct ratio. I just guessed which one was correct when I did not know which ratio the student had already seen. 
11,A1TPGXT718D68E,1484280,female,42,yes,3.0,no,I tried to give easy to understand ratios.
12,A1UZN21EAN1HZ4,2345082,female,54,yes,0.06,,"I did not use a strategy, probably why I did so poorly. I'm not very good at predictions."
13,A1YHIQHLLLQIIQ,930298,female,34,yes,1.29,,to send half of the turtles in one color to see how it would pair up 
14,A1ZLLYRW6GIVC7,2288731,female,32,yes,0.6,"Everything was straightforward, but it took me awhile to figure out a good strategy.","I used a math strategy. For example I couldn't put 70 out of 100, so I divided it by 2, than I showed the amount out of 10."
15,A222R4PNCF08OF,2573739,female,37,yes,0.2,no,try different numbers
16,A24GX1OZE6AY04,1113643,male,43,yes,1.5,"Very interesting and engaging, wonderful study, loved it, thank you and have a great day!","I just tried to steer them towards the correct answer, but I have to admit I didn't have a very sound strategy. In fact I'm sure I made a few mistakes. But I did give it my all! "
17,A27W025UEXS1G0,1192983,male,35,yes,1.33,Show some examples or hints on how to get the right answer.,I tried to enter the lowest color as a denominator of the highest color. I then adjusted the number based on which group of turtles I thought they already saw.
18,A29N6SFDF72SDS,1982754,female,33,yes,2.15,The students receiving 2 lessons would not show initial estimations every time. I guess I had expected it to and that confused me. ,"Trying to think of percentages, not being very good at it but at least sending turtle amounts that would cause ME to understand."
19,A2F1AA15HG0FRU,1793884,male,46,yes,4.67,Nope.,"No great strategy. I tried to push the student towards the right answer when I had enough information to do so, but when I didn't I just guessed at what would work."
20,A2MCG5W6LHSRG9,2018222,male,37,yes,2.33,The typing line above is annoying because you cant really see what your typing as the box is so small.,It took me way longer than I would like to admit to figure out a working strategy. I tried to send the correct amount of turtles to create the appropriate proportion. When we didn't know which side they observed I just picked one and took the chance. I would be able to update it if there was a road 2.
21,A2N9U74YIPDQ9F,1113154,female,55,yes,1.41,This was entirely too hard. I feel so dumb now.,I know there was one that would have worked but I literally have no clue what it would be.

25,A2RNCA7PK35LHT,3197570,female,40,yes,0.0,,Tried to average what the students had already seen with what I was sending them.
26,A2RRK8SV0VBLTJ,1170920,male,25,yes,2.0,I don't have any,I just tried giving the students the answer than work from there
27,A2VR9O234UCT9T,1496075,female,51,yes,2.1,,Tried to convey data statistically. If I knew how many turtles had definitely been seen tried to alter statistics by sending number of each to fix ratio in students minds
28,A2YC6PEMIRSOAA,2527783,female,39,yes,2.93,,Not sure tried to select the color that was most lacking
29,A314XJY8V1YL12,1635844,female,50,yes,2.0,no comments,send the numbers that made up a ratio based on 10 so that they could apply it to numbers out of 100.
30,A348NEQKS6VNIB,1811965,female,59,yes,2.58,,I just tried to send what they were shown and add the number of turtles to show the total of one of the color turtles.
31,A34YNEN8UUI3CD,1834320,male,40,yes,0.65,,Tried to make suggestive displays to the students but that really didnt work so I tried to manipulate them using the turtles and that didnt work either.
32,A36W9YOEXLJLBT,1054968,male,28,yes,1.86,,Show them a lot more of the one color if their experience hadn't matched the island population
33,A3774HPOUKYTX7,819228,male,42,yes,3.33,,I just went with my gut as to what to show them using the info the best I could
34,A37XBH865833FE,1175478,male,27,yes,2.0,,I tried to pick higher odd one
35,A3AY0315YWWNXY,953020,male,29,yes,0.13,"This was fun, but difficult to achieve a profitable response from the student.","No idea, anything I tried to do met with horrible guesses from the student."
36,A3FNC8ELMK8YJA,1719569,female,60,yes,1.0,,I entered whatever number was in the information given.
37,A3KF6O09H04SP7,1445293,male,38,yes,4.46,"That was pretty fun.  A few more rounds and think I could nail it every time, since I was starting to find the sweet spot.","It was different depending on the situation.  When I knew the exact proportion they had already seen, it was super simple.  I had to tinker to find the sweet spot for correcting their potential misinformation when there were multiple ratios they could have already seen."
38,A3L8LSM7V7KX3T,1417023,male,41,yes,2.72,No.,I tried to put myself into the student's shoes and figure out what what numbers would help me 
39,A3O0QZQ4V2IXT7,1563839,female,47,yes,0.5,This was a frustrating task.,"This was difficult. There really is no strategy. After failing several attempts it was clear the ""student"" might not be easily influenced. "
40,A3V57BKH58EUIY,1089878,female,38,yes,2.44,,putting the actual ratio of turtles as my suggestion
41,A3VEF4M5FIN7KH,1846421,male,38,yes,1.7,,I just based my turtle ratio sending on what info options were given to me.

43,A49HPQ9P5AHU4,1356890,male,46,yes,1.76,The student's first guess in most of the 2-round scenarios was never made visible. (It was in a minority of the cases.),I just kept trying to lead the students in the right direction by overemphasizing the ratios to offset what they had already seen
44,A49MD40UT6ABO,724603,female,25,yes,2.72,,I just did my best since I'm not very good at math.
45,A5WWHKD82I8UE,1029624,male,38,yes,3.25,,I was just randomly trying to throw out numbers that felt like they made sense. I wasn't quite getting lucky enough I suppose.
46,A748N8WFG2HR4,2186798,female,4,yes,0.1,,I tried to go with my gut feeling
47,ABX5OQLR6UNBC,1599906,female,49,yes,2.42,,"I tried to compensate for what the student saw or might have seen, and attempted to adjust their perception."
48,AEQ95NMC3VXQ5,1264802,female,66,yes,1.08,Thank you for the opportunity to participate,I tried experimenting with different ratios of turtle colors
49,AFRJKS3Z3H4CA,1172629,male,41,yes,2.18,None,I just tried to get them close to a good breakdown when all scenarios are considered. If they had seen unknown amounts of turtles earlier I tried to do an average of both possibilities to get closer to the truth
50,AIA7RZSAONU5M,1165693,female,37,yes,2.14,"No comments, thank you!",I tried to give the student an accurate ratio of orange to purple turtles.
51,AK1GE19RT3PK6,1184622,male,34,yes,2.0,none,"I just went with my intuition and what worked for me sometimes that got me the bonus, however it was a difficult task but I tried my best."
52,AM65LGXJBTJ0I,1554017,male,33,yes,5.14,"Give a bigger textbox to write our strategy. Other than that, it was great, thank you!","For situations where there would only be 1 trial or 2 trials with no feedback on what their 1st guess was, I focused on 1 of the possible scenarios only. For instance, if an island had 7 purple/3 orange then I would focus on the scenario where the student had seen 9 purple/1 orange. This is because the alternative scenario was 1 purple/9 orange and it was too far removed from reality to try to change the student's perception. So my strategy would be to correct the 9purple/1orange student by slightly underrepresting purple by showing 6 purple/4orange. This seemed to result in a 50% chance of the student geussing correctly (in the case where I got the 9 purple/1 orange student) and a 50% chance of getting nothing (in the case where I got the 1 purple/9 orange student). I'm guessing there are better strategies, but this seemed decent and I couldn't come up with anything better on the 1 trial/2trials with no feedback scenarios.  For the scenarios where there were 2 trials and I got to see their guess after the 1st trial, it was more straightforward. I would just correclty represent the composition of turtles on trial #1, then look at their guess to figure out which student I got and try to compensate in trial 2 accordingly."
53,AOIR8V07FYMH5,2712568,male,35,yes,5.46,"I sent 0 on one round because the ratio they had predicted was accurate, so I didn't want to show any more turtles, which didn't pay me a bonus even though it was correctly predicted.",I would make it a ratio that would match the end result.
54,APVJEN2541WFB,1383322,female,32,yes,2.52,"The only comment I would have is to maybe add a practice round at the start, though I understand this might mess with data so maybe not. ","I just tried to equal them out to get them as close as possible, my strategy obviously did not work out well it was tougher than I anticipated. "

56,AUZXHSWDT1PYQ,1377569,female,31,yes,3.05,N/A,I tried to show increments of the ratio of turtles
57,AVCOBHDVXZOZL,1243994,male,35,no,0.76,provide a better way to get a bonus thin this. or at least provbide some examples on what a round will go like if you get the max bonus or a lower bonus,none
