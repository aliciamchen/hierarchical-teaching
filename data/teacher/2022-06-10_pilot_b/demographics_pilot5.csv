0,A19F9CLZ0XWBYR,837367,female,28,yes,,"I couldn't figure out one that really worked, so I was just trying different numbers each time to see what strategy would work, but I never got there."
1,A19X8IA9EKC3XH,1731456,male,36,yes,n/a,"I tried to ratio the amount buy how many turtles each student may/ or may not have seen.  If a student saw 9 orange turtles and 1 purple turtle, but the actually ration was 3 orange and 7 purple, then i would multiply the higher amount by 3, and add a small a much smaller amount to the lower end."
2,A1FNNL4YJGBU8U,2264184,male,26,yes,,I tried to base it off the actual compositon but truthfully i found this whole experiment confusing. 
3,A1GCTKOPKUTW3G,985121,male,32,yes,,I tried to provide numbers that would show similar percentages of turtles compared to the actual number.
4,A1S2EXYEG5I8HW,1100972,female,29,yes,,"I completely understood the instructions, did not understand the method at allllllll"
5,A1V2H0UF94ATWY,1544106,male,62,yes,,tried to influence total number of turtles seen but found it difficult
6,A1VRG5HKZC0H0C,1173136,male,37,yes,N/A,I tried to do quick math calculations to figure out how to get within a reasonable difference from actuals.
7,A27TE0L5XP1H0U,1508530,male,44,yes,This was an interesting study and I wish I had more lessons to teach to see if I could further improve.,When I could use two lessons I would try to adjust enough to get them to shift their score quite a bit if it is off a fair amount.  I adjusted technique as lessons went along because my methods did not work good at all at the start.
8,A2AAFWAAS9C1QC,1321998,female,47,yes,Enjoyed the tasks. It was a lot of fun. Wish I had done better though. I don't think I'd make a good teacher.,I got lucky a couple of times on the ones with two chances using the strategy of giving them the ratio in each box on one trial and then giving them an amount equal to the ratio in another trial. I just couldn't get anything to work on the single trials. Got so close on a few but just fell short.
9,A2B2HQHFBYLTXU,1465283,male,39,yes,I have no comments or suggestions. ,At the end I decided to send a higher amount of animal collections. 
10,A2C84POENS2UNY,1010308,female,41,yes,,"I tried to adjust my lessons to reflect the proper ratio of turtles, or to correct an imbalance in the ratio they were assuming"
11,A2EMTSJS47K8SU,1085496,male,34,yes,,"My strategy initially was to use the absolute least amount of turtles I thought would help, but later deceided to up it when they weren't guessing remotely close."
12,A2V27A9GZA1NR2,1057253,male,40,yes,Thank You,I was trying to use proper proportions... 
13,A2ZDEERVRN5AMC,1169664,male,30,no,"I appreciate the opportunity regardless of my poor performance. I'm a real human, by the way.","I thought my strategy would go based on common sense, but that didn't seem to work. I don't really know how I can get accurate guesses if I personally didn't know the entire turtle composition myself. The figures I was supplied always made it seem as if the turtle number was always fact, such as being a 7/3 split, meaning the islands should have always had 30 of one type and 70 of the other. I was overall confused."
14,A36SM7QM8OK3H6,1577897,female,35,yes,at least 1 example round to get us adjusted to the game,"I was hoping that they could do math and see that if they added up the number of turtles they could directly see the percentage, or close to it, of orange to purple turtles. but that wasn't working so I just tried thinking about how to work with their perception of what they thought the island had. I'm clearly not very good at teaching but I did try :)"
15,A3G5OWGKHW6OL5,1209513,male,35,yes,,I would try to hint at what the actual distribution of turtles were for each round.
16,A3GLUDQZGEJL5G,1554879,female,28,yes,,At first I tried going with 3 and 7 matching the info I was given but the students weren't getting it so I tried smaller numbers and got one student to get it right.
17,A3LC6M2EMDBBXP,970326,female,32,yes,,Send the fewest turtles but still try to get the message across. Though occasionally double or triple the ratio
18,A3N0QZ9ZKUCTCQ,1476431,male,33,yes,,"I sent an amount of turtles such that, the students will realized that one color of turtles is more than the other in a 7/3 ratio. If I'm sure they have already seen a certain amount of a certain color, it would be easy to match the 7/3 ratio by sending enough to match an equivalent amount, otherwise, I would stick to a usual amount such as 28/12 nearly each time."
19,A3NRIEMOJVVX4A,1187590,male,39,yes,none,To tell them what was there. 
20,A3RCX3IQ8L6HHW,996256,female,50,yes,It would be good to go through several practice rounds. I don't think I really got the hang of it until the end. Also the 90 second time limit stressed me out so that some of my choices weren't very thoughtful.,If I was given 2 tries I was able to try to adjust. With only one try it was more of a guess.
21,A3V9JFVZQ2XF4Y,1122349,male,40,yes,"It would have been nice to play for a few more rounds. This was more entertaining than expected, especially with the bonuses.","I used a relatively small number of turtles to preserve any bonus I might get. I noticed that the students' guesses were based on averages of turtles they'd seen, so I tried to send enough to manipulate this average."
22,A5OBJUPZLVOKG,1649128,male,39,yes,,I never really felt settled into a good strategy.. I tried to really overdo the proportions when it seemed like they wouldn't respond to just giving them an accurate proportion
23,A98E8M4QLI9RS,1370488,female,55,yes,I think more detail instructions with an example or two would be helpful,"I tried to show them the exact ratio, but maybe I was doing something wrong"
24,AFJFYJZ849YOZ,1058784,female,23,yes,I understood the instructions but the game was really hard,"I honestly could not figure it out, it was a very hard game "
25,AK1Q45RF8A87Z,1560810,female,57,yes,,I sent the same numbers I was given for both the orange and blue turtles.
26,AKAM01E1R4KAF,1071732,male,35,yes,none,"Realize that they didn't learn, so it didn't matter"
27,AMPR904VJJFZY,1034092,female,29,yes,no,7 and 3 mimic the actual
28,APGX2WZ59OWDN,787375,female,28,yes,,Trying to think about what turtles they've seen and how it affected their estimates
29,APRZ7BR8C0ZMQ,2325184,male,58,yes,,Tried to send a balance of turtles to correct past bad assumptions.
30,AQRKP48O0WKBW,696318,male,29,yes,,use island ratio
