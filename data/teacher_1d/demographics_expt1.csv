125,ANZKTE853UXSD,1165892,male,37,yes,2.92,,At first I just sent them the correct ratio then I started trying to correct the ratios they had already seen by sending a lot more turtles.,0
126,AOXM7IK32TST5,933608,male,35,yes,6.31,Thank you!,I hoped that the student would have seen the group that was closest to the actual ratio. That way I would only show them a small number of turtles and get a bigger bonus. Too lazy to do the math to figure out the ratios to send to get it right every time.,3
127,AP9WIQ4P78XLH,1253617,male,51,yes,1.7,,Try to duplicate the ration with as many turtles as I could calulate quickly.,3

135,ATT8TOPRCRRHG,947755,female,26,yes,0.0,No comments. Thank you for allowing me to participate!,I tried to show them as little as possible so that my bonus was as big as possible. The bulk of each group i showed my students was the group with the higher amount of that color turtle there. I tried to show the amounts of them there without spending alot of money as efficiently as i could.,3
