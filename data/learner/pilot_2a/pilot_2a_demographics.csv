6,A1FHC4Z6QXDQSS,1306561,male,39,yes,2.2,I entered the wrong info on the first attention check realized it after did read it but was so into the game wasn't think and the was like oh no ,I would add what the teacher saw and I saw together and then try to decide whats more likely,0

17,A25PFSORDO3SWQ,1308879,male,35,yes,5.5,,"I tried not to use the guess so I could maximize my winnings. I then thought about the numbers the teacher sent and trying to decide if I thought they knew I saw turtles before they taught me or not. Then depending on what the teacher showed me for round 2, I would try to think if I should go with the yellow or purple as the majority. If they sent low amounts for the one color and a high amount for the other color, that made me think I was supposed to believe that the higher amounts were the majority color. When the numbers were closer together it was harder to decide.",2

24,A2O2Q0LVWOWJ1G,729464,female,48,yes,3.4,I enjoyed taking part. ,I just went with the number of turtles I saw and was shown and made an assumption based on those numbers. ,2
25,A2PQDK3MLDFXYM,943481,female,30,yes,4.9,,I looked at what I saw and if the teacher showed more of one color than what I saw then I said they didn't know.,2

48,AKP66RIZ3LQVX,1434924,male,24,yes,3.0,,"I just looked at the ratio of the turtles I'd seen in total,  and went with the ratio I found there. So if I saw 12 purple and 6 orange, I went with the 7 purple: 3 orange ratio.

Also, if my teacher showed me x amount of 1 color and 0 of the other color, I used that as an indicator that they knew what I saw and they were trying to heavily influence my answer.
