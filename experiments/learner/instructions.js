        `<h2>üèù Archipelago üèù</h2>
        <p class="instruction">
        You have just landed on a new archipelago, consisting of many different islands. You're
        there to study the famous rainbow turtles. </p>

        <p class="instruction">
        You've heard that on some islands, <b style="color:purple;">purple</b> turtles are more common, and on others, <b style="color:orange;">orange</b>
        turtles are more common. You'd like to learn what sort of island each island is.
        </p>`,

        `
        <h2>Different islands</h2>
        <p class="instruction">
            Interestingly enough, there are <strong>four</strong> different types of islands in the archipelago:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Completely purple (100% purple)</li>
            <li>Mostly purple (30% orange, 70% purple)</li>
            <li>Mostly orange (70% orange, 30% purple)</li>
            <li>Completely orange (100% orange)</li>
        </ul>
        `,

        `<h2>How will I learn about each island?</h2>
        <p class="instruction">
        Some local residents luckily have agreed to help show you around a total of
        <b>${params.nTrials}</b> different islands. Every time you arrive on a new island, you will
        be matched with a new teacher üßë‚Äçüè´
        </p>
        <!-- insert a teacher image here maybe? -->
        <p class="instruction">
        This teacher knows where all the turtles on the island live and how many of them
        are orange compared to purple. They will <b>take you to see turtles that live in
        distinct regions of the island</b> to help you learn.
        </p>
        <p class="instruction">
        So the teacher will give you information to <b>help you figure out the composition of each island</b> Each teacher will show you <b>two
        sets</b> of orange and purple turtles from the island.
        </p>
        <p class="instruction">
        At the end of each block, you will guess the composition of the island. You will receive a bonus each time you
        successfully guess the island composition!
        </p>`,

        `
        <h2>Prior knowledge</h2>
        <p class="instruction">
        <b>Before</b> the teacher begins to show you around each island, you will
        <b>have already come across ten turtles on the island.</b>
        On some of these islands, nine out of the ten turtles you come across will have been orange.
        On some other islands, nine out of the ten turtles you come across will have been purple.
        We will give you this information every time you arrive on a new island.
        </p>
        <p class="instruction">
        Sometimes, the teacher will know exactly which turtles you have seen, but other times
        they will be uncertain <b>as to whether you saw 9 orange turtles or 9 purple turtles
        out of 10 turtles.</b>
        </p>
        <p class="instruction">
        <b>We won't tell you</b> whether the teacher <b>knows or doesn't know</b>
        what you have already seen.
        </p>`,

        `<p class="instruction">
        All teachers will teach through two lessons.
        </p>`,

        `<h3 class="instruction">Lesson 1</h3>
        <p class="instruction">
        Based on their knowledge of what you have seen, on the first lesson the teacher will
        show you an additional number of orange and purple turtles from the island to help
        you learn the island composition.
        </p>
        <p class="instruction">
        Using these examples, you will use a slider to guess whether <b>the teacher
        knew what turtles you initially saw.</b>
        </p>
        <p class="instruction">
        Then, you will have an option to send information to the teacher. You can select
        whether you would like to <b>enter a guess for the island composition</b> and send it
        to the teacher.
        </p>
        <p class="instruction">
        If you send a guess, the teacher will consider this guess when showing you
        the second set of turtles.
        </p>`,

        `<h3 class="instruction">Lesson 2</h3>
        <p class="instructions">
        In this lesson, the teacher will <b>send you a second set of example turtles.</b>
        </p>
        <p class="instruction">
        Then, you will enter your final guess for what type of island you are on.
        </p>`,

        `<p class="instructions">
        Then the block will end and you will move on to the next block,
        where you will encounter a new teacher on a <em>completely new island.</em>
        </p>`,

        `<h3>How to earn a bonus</h3>
        <p class="instruction">
        Every time you select the correct island <b>during the final lesson</b>, you will
        earn a bonus of $${params.perTrialBonus.toFixed(2)}.
        </p>
        <p class="instruction">
        Sending feedback to the teacher costs money: every time you send feedback
        to the teacher, $${params.feedbackCost.toFixed(2)} will be subtracted from your bonus.
        </p>`,
