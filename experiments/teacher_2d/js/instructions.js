    <p>
    You live on Mycotopia, an archipelago of islands that is famous for its large variety of native mushrooms üçÑ
    </p>
    <p>Locals know that some of the mushrooms are <b>tasty</b> but others are <b>bitter</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Every year people visit the islands to taste the mushrooms, but it's often hard for them to tell the difference between tasty mushrooms and bitter ones. üòï

    <p>
    The first thing every child learns on Mycotopia is that mushrooms primarily differ in their <strong>stem height</strong> and <strong>cap width</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can always tell whether a mushroom is tasty or bitter based on these two features, but <b>different islands have different rules</b>; a mushroom that is tasty on one island may be bitter on another island.

    </p>
    ${makeGridFromHTML(3.5, 'less', 6.5, 'greater', gridhtml, '1.8vw')}
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
    But on another island, it may be the other way around:

    ${makeGridFromHTML(3.5, 'greater', 6.5, 'less', gridhtml, '1.8vw')}
    <br>
